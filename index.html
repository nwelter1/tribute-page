                <li>
                    <p>Darwin was born on the same day as Abraham Lincoln. Both Darwin and Lincoln were born on February 12, 1809, but in much different settings. While America’s 16th president was born in a rude log cabin in the Kentucky wilderness, Darwin was born in a grand Georgian house on an estate overlooking the River Severn and the medieval market town of Shrewsbury, England.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He waited more than 20 years to publish his groundbreaking theory on evolution. Concerned about the public acceptance of his radical idea, he did not present his theory on evolution until 1858 when he made a joint announcement with naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, who was about to go public with a similar concept.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He dropped out of medical school. Darwin hated the sight of blood and was bored with the lectures. He left medical school in 1825, dashing his father’s dreams.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He dined on exotic animals. Darwin not only studied an eclectic menagerie of animals from around the globe, he ate them as well. He was known to snack on armadillo, ostrich, and puma.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He didn’t coin the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Although associated with Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the phrase “survival of the fittest” was actually first used by English philosopher Herbert Spencer in his 1864 “Principles of Biology” to connect his economic and sociological theories with Darwin’s biological concepts</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Darwin appeared on the 10-pound note for 18 years. Beginning in 2000, a portrait of a bearded Darwin appeared on the back of the British 10-pound note along with an image of HMS Beagle, a magnifying lens and flora and fauna seen on his travels.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Darwin was a divinity student. After leaving the University of Edinburgh, the man who would challenge the established religious dogma of creationism enrolled at Cambridge to study theology. “I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible,” he later wrote</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He composed a pro/con list to decide on whether to marry. Displaying a logical inclination even in matters of the heart, Darwin in 1838 composed a list with two columns delineating the upsides and downsides of marriage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Darwin suffered from chronic illnesses. After returning from his trip around the world, Darwin began to suffer from exhaustion, eczema and chronic bouts of nausea, headaches and heart palpitations that would persist for the rest of his life.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Darwin’s ideas created a lot of discussion regarding the impact on various scientific, religious and philosophical viewpoints. Although most of those in educated society accepted the theory of evolution, many still challenge its existence despite the wealth of evidence supporting it.</p>
